## Key Points

- The Regulatory Tracker is an AI-powered application that automates detection, analysis, and workflow management of regulatory updates using Claude AI as a backend agent
- User journey spans seven phases from initial dashboard access through scan configuration, execution, results review, workflow management, knowledge store curation, and documentation export
- Backend orchestration uses a multi-stage scan pipeline: initializing → retrieving sources → detecting changes → analyzing (via Claude) → scoring → generating artifacts → finalizing
- System uses mock regulatory sources (FinCEN amendments, SAR advisories, OCC guidance, Federal Reserve procedures) with automated keyword detection and SHA-256 content hashing
- Claude AI performs relevance analysis, impact assessment (Low/Medium/High/Critical), and confidence scoring; items with confidence <0.7 are flagged for human review
- Workflow management enables compliance teams to transition items through Draft → In Review → Verified states, with verified items accessible in the Knowledge Store
- Pre-generated Word documents (.docx) provide professional compliance documentation with executive summaries, impact assessments, and recommended actions
