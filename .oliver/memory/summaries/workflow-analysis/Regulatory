## Key Points

- Regulatory Tracker is an AI-powered application that monitors regulatory changes using Claude AI as a backend agent to automate detection, analysis, and workflow management
- System follows a 7-phase user journey from initial dashboard access through scan configuration, execution, results review, workflow management, and knowledge store management
- Backend orchestration uses a multi-stage pipeline (Initializing → Retrieving Sources → Detecting Changes → Analyzing → Scoring → Generating Artifacts → Finalizing) with specialized agent components
- Claude AI analyzes regulatory documents for relevance, impact level (Low/Medium/High/Critical), affected compliance areas, and generates confidence scores; items below 0.7 confidence are flagged for human review
- System generates professional artifacts including markdown summaries and Word documents for verified regulatory changes, stored in a searchable knowledge store with export functionality
- Nine critical decision points throughout the workflow balance automated detection with human oversight, from parameter validation through knowledge store verification

## Entities and Topics

- **ScanOrchestrator**: Backend component that coordinates multi-stage scan pipeline and manages state transitions
- **ChangeDetectionService**: Detects material changes using content hashing and regulatory keyword matching
- **LLMService**: Integrates with Claude API (claude-sonnet-4) for regulatory document analysis and structured JSON response parsing
- **ArtifactGenerator**: Creates markdown summaries and Word documents for compliance reporting
- **FinCEN CDD Amendment**: High-impact mock regulatory source reducing beneficial ownership threshold from 25% to 10%
- **Regulatory domains**: AML (Anti-Money Laundering), KYC, Transaction Monitoring, SAR Filing
- **Workflow statuses**: Draft, In Review, Verified (with knowledge store integration)

## Relevance to Project

This document provides comprehensive technical specification of the Regulatory Tracker application's user journey and backend orchestration architecture. It maps the complete workflow from scan initiation through AI-powered analysis to human review and knowledge store management, establishing the design foundation for implementing an automated regulatory compliance monitoring system.
