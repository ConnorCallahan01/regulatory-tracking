## Key Points

- Regulatory Tracker is an AI-powered application that continuously monitors regulatory changes using Claude AI backend with mock agentic orchestration
- System follows a 7-phase user journey from initial dashboard access through scan configuration, execution, results review, workflow management, and knowledge store integration
- Backend scan pipeline includes 7 automated stages: initializing, retrieving sources, detecting changes, analyzing with Claude AI, scoring confidence levels, generating artifacts, and finalizing
- Key decision points occur at user, system, and AI levels—including parameter validation, material change detection, impact analysis by Claude, and human review flagging for low-confidence items
- Results flow through workflow states (Draft → In Review → Verified) with user-controlled transitions and comments before being archived in the searchable knowledge store
- Four backend agent components orchestrate the process: ScanOrchestrator, ChangeDetectionService, LLMService, and ArtifactGenerator

## Entities and Topics

- **Regulatory Tracker**: AI-powered application for monitoring and analyzing regulatory changes across domains and jurisdictions
- **ScanOrchestrator**: Backend component coordinating multi-stage scan pipeline with state transitions and error handling
- **Claude AI (claude-sonnet-4)**: LLM used for analyzing regulatory content relevance, impact level determination, and generating recommendations
- **ChangeDetectionService**: Service that detects material changes through keyword analysis and SHA-256 content hashing
- **ArtifactGenerator**: Component creating markdown summaries and Word documents for compliance documentation
- **Mock Data Sources**: FinCEN amendments, SAR advisories, OCC guidance, and Federal Reserve AML procedures used for demonstration
- **Workflow Management**: Status-based tracking system (Draft, In Review, Verified) with user-controlled transitions
- **Knowledge Store**: Searchable archive of verified regulatory items with filtering and export capabilities

## Relevance to Project

This document provides a comprehensive technical specification of the Regulatory Tracker application's complete user journey and backend agent architecture. It serves as essential design documentation for understanding system workflows, decision points, data flow, and component interactions—critical for development, testing, and future enhancements of the regulatory monitoring system.
